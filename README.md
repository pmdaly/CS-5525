CS 5525 - Machine Learning
===

- this repo houses all of the Machine Learning algorithms we've implemented for
  various homeworks
- all files can generate loss plots if "loss" is added as a final argument
- the runner files below aren't commented much but the actual souce code is

mySmoSVM
===
$ python3 mySmoSVM dataset filename numruns
w/ plots use loss

$ python3 mySmoSVM dataset filename numruns loss

myPegasos
===
$ python3 myPegasos dataset filename k numruns

w/ plots use loss
$ python3 myPegasos dataset filename k numruns loss

mySVRG
===
$ python3 mySVRG dataset filename m numruns loss

w/ plots use loss
$ python3 mySVRG dataset filename m numruns
